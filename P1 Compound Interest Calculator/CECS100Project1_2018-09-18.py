# "Compound Interest"

# Corresponds to pp. 106 + 107 in text
# Objective: calculate compound interest given rate, number of times compounded, and time
# -----------------------------------------------------------

#Formula:
    # A = P(1 + (r/n))^(nt)
        # A = final amount
        # P = principle
        # r = interest rate
        # n = number of times interest is compounded per year
        # t = time (years)

# init variables
P = 0.0
r = 0.0
n = 0.0
t = 0.0

bank account using a few values: the amount you put in, the annual interest rate (as a decimal), the
amount of times your bank compounds your money (you can figure this out by calling your bank), and the
number of years you plan to have your money in your account.\n""")
